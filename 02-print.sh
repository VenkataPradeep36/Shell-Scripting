        impact in Odisha quickly devolved into a comedy segment of sorts
        when the man he stopped for an interview gave him a brutally honest
        reply to his query. Parts of Odisha have been experiencing high-speed winds          and heavy rains due to the "very severe cyclonic storm" Yaas.
         In such inclement weather conditions, the reporter for Naxatra News was
         surprised to see people out and about - and questioned one man about why he
          chose to step out in the midst of a cyclone."
